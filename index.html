          <h2><a href="http://vimeo.com/106198518">Keynote: Mike Bostock</a>, The New York Times</h2>
          <div>&quot;The Toolmakers Guide&quot;
            <ul><li>Mike Bostock known for New York Times, D3.js, TopoJson</li>
              <li>People are pushed to use defaults in a tool even if changes are possible.</li>
              <li>RGB color space doesn't have equivelant change in perception for equivilent change in each color channel intensity. This was default color space in the D3 tool. Now provides perceptual color spaces. Now &quot;HCL&quot; and &quot;Color Brewer&quot; and &quot;Cube Helix&quot;</li>
              <li><em>Important!</em>Provide examples that use the best practices even for things that are not the point of the example.</li>
              <li>Map Projection Bias:<ul>
                <li>Thought of a point transformation.</li>
                <li>However, this ignores cutting the sphere.</li>
                <li>Projection system needs to be a gneric geometry transformation.</li>
                <li>Mercator projected data even in Lat Lon  coordinates is not truely spherical data. Straight lines in Mercator are great circles. But transformations to other projections rarely transform those great circles correctly.</li></ul></li>
              <li>Solve the smallest possible interesting problem.</li>
              <li>People don't use tools in the way the designer intended. Design them to fail obviously and usefully.</li>
              <li>Standards based tools reduce the &quot;viscosity&quot; of switching to different tools.</li></ul></div>

          <h3>Track 2: Client-side versus server-side geoprocessing: Benchmarking the performance of web browsers processing geospatial data using common GIS operations. - Erin Hamilton, University of Wisconsin-Madison</h3>
          <div>
          <ul>
            <li>Testing suite based on <a href="http://www.vividsolutions.com/jts/JTSHome.htm">JTS</a></li>
            <li>Tested randomized data sets sized up to 3.8MB</li>
            <li>Tested multiple browsers and multiple OSes</li>
            <li>Machines had different specs but results were normalized using Geek Bench results</li>
            <li>Results:
              <ul>
                <li>IE and Safari were slowest browsers on client side</li>
                <li>Firefox could process 30,000+ vertices, no other browsers could</li>
                <li>Server at least an order of magnitude faster than any browser</li>
                <li>With a 1 second wait tolerance, could process ~1k vertices</li>
                <li>With a 10 second wait tolerance, could process ~10k vertices</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Conclusion: Sever was faster. The server was a &quot;medium&quot; Amazon server instance.</li>
            <li>Testing was with only 1 simultaneous user</li>
            <li>Details in <a href="http://erinhamilton.me/portfolio/Erin_Hamilton_Masters_Thesis.pdf">masters thesis</a></li>
            <li>Several developers in the audience were skeptical of results being so poor in the client side browsers. These are likely the people writing the JavaScript tools that were being tested. Speakers defense was that the analysis being tested was implemented using the online documentation that is currently available for these tools.</li>
